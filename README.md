### o Data Exploration:
I started by exploring the sales data, visualizing sales trends over time to understand patterns and seasonality.

### o Decomposition Analysis: 
Utilized seasonal decomposition to break down the data into trend, seasonality, and residual components, gaining deeper insights into sales patterns.

### o Model Building: 
Employed Exponential Smoothing with seasonal components to build a robust forecasting model, leveraging historical sales data.

### o Results: 
The model accurately predicted future sales trends, enabling better decision-making and resource allocation for inventory management and business planning.

### o Impact: 
By implementing data-driven demand forecasting, businesses can optimize inventory levels, reduce stockouts, and enhance customer satisfaction.
